1. Navigate to this directory in your terminal:
   ```bash
   cd Resume-Insights-Frontend
   ```
2. Start a simple Python HTTP server (requires Python installed):
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```
3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port indicated by the server).
